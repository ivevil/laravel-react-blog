# Frontend: React ||Â Backend: PHP/Laravel

This blog is created on Blade templates as a frontend running on Laravel framework. 
For backend we created custom cms specially created for this blog. There are several widgets used for inputing data for frontend.
An idea was to create fully custom CMS for various frontends showing data pulled from CMS. 
Currently we are working on improving API which is going to be used for frontend running on React.
